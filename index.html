            This library is intended to make the life of a C++ programmer
            easier when working with strings. Anyone who is familiar with
            C/C++ programming is privy to the standard implementation of
            strings in C also known as "C-Style strings". Before moving
            any further it makes sense to first define what a C++ library
            is.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <u>C++ class libraries</u> are modular components of reusable
            code.
            Using class libraries, you can integrate blocks of code that have
            been previously built and tested.
            A C++ library consists of one or more header files and an object
            library. The header files provide class and other definitions
            needed to access the library functions. The object library
            provides compiled functions and data that are linked with your
            program to produce an executable program.
        </p>
        <p>
            The traditional C-string is an array of characters terminated
            by a special null character whose value is 0 which marks the
            end of the string.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are some advantages of C-strings:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Compile-time allocation and determination of size. This
                    makes them more efficient, faster run-time when using them
                </li>
                <li>
                    Simplest possible storage, conserves space.
                </li>
            </ul>
            The C-strings are easy to use in some cases like when
            used as literals, for passing as parameters to functions, for
            basic traversal etc. However, they have some disadvantages as
            well which can lead to memory leaks and buffer overflows if we
            are not careful.
        </p>
        <p>
            Disadvantages of C-strings:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    They have a fixed size since they are implemented as
                    arrays.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Primitive C arrays do not track their own size, so a
                    programmer has to be careful about the array boundaries.
                </li>
                <li>
                    While there are some library functions that work with
                    C-strings, programmer still has to be careful to make
                    correct calls. These library functions do not protect
                    boundaries either! Take for example the function strcat
                    which is a library function found in the string.h header.
                    It appends a copy of a string (say src) to another string
                    (say dest) and null terminates it. The function does not
                    check if the required amount of space is available at
                    dest or not it just copies the src string. This can lead
                    to buffer overflows if the programmer is not careful and
                    buffer overflows can result in overwriting of possibly
                    crucial and executable code which can be disastrous.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Less intuitive notation for such usage (library features).
                    For example, it feels more intuitive when concatenation of
                    two strings is performed using the '+' operator than when
                    using a separate function.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            The <strong>string</strong> library has been designed keeping in
            mind all the above points and more. It abstracts away all the
            unncecessary details and intricacies of C-strings and provides
            the user with an interface which is intuitive and easy to use.
        </p>
        <p>
            It provides a much more flexible way to work with and manipulate
            strings.
